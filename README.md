# Schematalog

API for cataloguing JSON Schema specifications.

The name is a portmanteau of the words "schemata" (the original plural form of "schema") and "catalog(ue)", which very aptly describes the purpose of this project: it is a simple RESTful API that allows storing JSON Schema documents in one place, from which they can be retrieved for purposes of validation of messages and documents.
